                <p class="para2">Completed my second year of college pursuing BTech in Computer Science feels fantastic!
                    Learning C++ language and web development in my third and fourth semester was a thrilling
                    introduction to the coding world. I'm amazed by how much there is to learn every day, all driven by
                    logic and patience. Now, exiting my sophomore year and proceeding to my third year, I'm eager to
                    explore new concepts and become a
                    better version of myself. The journey ahead looks promising, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the
                    world of coding. ðŸ˜Š</p>

                            Iâ€™m proficient in HTML, able to structure websites effectively. Iâ€™m familiar with various
                            tags and their properties, allowing me to build a comprehensive website framework. My skills

                            I have strong CSS skills, focusing on styling to enhance the presentation of a project. I
                            know how to effectively apply styles to various tags to make the design more appealing. My
                            expertise includes optimizing elements such as fonts, colors, margins, and layout properties
                            to ensure a polished and professional look for the project.

                            Iâ€™m skilled in JavaScript, capable of integrating scripts into HTML to control webpage
                            interactions. I understand how to make a page respond to actions like button clicks and am
                            familiar with concepts such as DOM manipulation and API calls. This enables me to create
                            dynamic and interactive web experiences.

                            In C++, Iâ€™ve mastered templates, classes, and friend functions. Iâ€™ve applied these skills in
                            projects, such as building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. My experience includes leveraging templates
                            for generic programming and using classes and friend functions to structure and manage code
                            effectively.

                            JavaScript. Iâ€™m familiar with key concepts such as `useState` for managing state and
                            `useEffect` for handling side effects. This knowledge helps in building more efficient and
                            maintainable user interfaces. </p>

                    My friends and I participated in a college coding event called CodeClash, where we developed a
                    website named TheNyayRoom. We built the entire site using HTML and CSS, incorporating various
                    sections such as About, Login, and Signup. This project allowed us to showcase our skills in
                    creating a structured and visually appealing website.

                    polished and professional look. The project showcases my ability to design a visually appealing and
